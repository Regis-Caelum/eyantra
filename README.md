Allowing the user to locate the nearest hospital having sufficient supplies for beds and enough vacancy for admission.

* The first page to display is a Index page for users to search for nearest vacant hospital beds along with a option to login the system and login for hospital authorities.

* After logging into the admin/system section the user have the privilage to add more hospital authorities.

* After logging into the hospital authority section the user have the privilage to update the number of beds vacant and number of supplies for that corresponding hospital
